A modern **AI-powered Attendance System** built using **Face Recognition** and **Streamlit UI**.  
This project detects faces in real-time using your webcam and automatically marks attendance — fast, simple, and efficient! 🚀

---

## 🌟 Features
✅ Register faces by uploading images (auto-saved in `registered_faces/`)  
✅ Real-time webcam detection using `face_recognition` + `OpenCV`  
✅ Marks attendance with Name, Time, and Date  
✅ Displays attendance table live in the app  
✅ Simple, clean, and fast **Streamlit** interface  
✅ Optional: Export attendance as CSV file

## 🚀 Future Scope

The AI Attendance System can be further improved and expanded with the following features:

- 📱 **Mobile App Integration:**  
  Create a companion mobile app for marking and viewing attendance on the go.

- ☁️ **Cloud Database Integration:**  
  Store attendance data on cloud platforms like Firebase or MongoDB for remote access and real-time syncing.

- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model Optimization:**  
  Improve face recognition accuracy using advanced deep learning models (e.g., FaceNet, DeepFace).

- 🎓 **Multi-Classroom / Organization Support:**  
  Allow multiple departments or classes to use the same system with separate dashboards.

- 🔔 **Automated Notifications:**  
  Send alerts or emails to students/employees when attendance is marked or missed.

- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Add a dashboard to visualize daily, weekly, and monthly attendance statistics.

- 🪪 **ID & Role-Based Access:**  
  Introduce admin, teacher, and student-level permissions for better control.
